# Pet Medical Records

## Introduction

Pet Medical Records (PMR) is a system where an owner can create clinics, pets, and records to store their pet's vaccine information.  

This is useful for pet parents who need to board their pets, take them to pet day care, or to a new groomer.  

It is easy to lose the paper documents and having a centralized database of the records can help pet parents keep track of their documents. 

TODO: Implement file uploading to store pictures of the record or a pdf. 

## Architecture

This project uses MVC with n-tier architecture to properly separate parts of the application.
